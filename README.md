# Getting Started with Create React App

Project is build using the create-react-app cli and being deployed over [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)

[Demo](https://github-weekly-popular-repos.ekas.vercel.app/) is also available

## Project Build Instructions

Make sure you've [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed in your system.

Open terminal and follow these steps;

- Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekas/github-weekly-popular-repos.git
```

You should now see a `github-weekly-popular-repos` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd github-weekly-popular-repos/
```

- Step 2: Install dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

This will use `yarn` to install project dependencies.

- Step 3: Start the project.

```bash
yarn start
```

This will run a local instance of the application `http://localhost:3000/`
